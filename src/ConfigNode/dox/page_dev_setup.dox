\section dev_setup_env Setting environmental variables and eth interface

In the /etc/environment file a entry for WS_KROS must be added pointing to the orion-ros2-config
repository.

Example Entry:
 <code>
  WS_KROS=/home/marcus/Code/orion-ros2-config/
 </code>
 
 If the infrastructure docker container should be used together with a Xavier the
 98-net-orion.rules must be adapted according the used network interface used for the Xavier
 connection. This rule renames the corepsonding ethernet adapter to
 Example for a USB Network adapter /dev/eth_orion and is used in scripts to brige it to the docker
 network
 
 <code>
  SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*",
  ATTRS{idVendor}=="0bda",ATTRS{idProduct}=="8153",, ATTR{type}=="1", KERNEL=="eth*",
  NAME="eth_orion"
  </code>
\section dev_setup_docker Setup docker dev environment

Precondition docker must be installed
Execute from the docker directory of this repository the
build_image.sh.
<code>
 ./buildimage.sh
 </code>
 
 from the docker directory of this repository. Takes some time and uses also around 6GB of disk
 space.
 
 It creates two images:
     - orion:dev full ros2 build and execution environment, this will be also used in future to do
       cross compilation for Xavier
     - orion:infra nginx and mosquito installation
 
 and a network called orion_nw with subnet 172.18.0.0/24 and the corresponding bridge (orion_br),
 in case a network device eth_orion is available it will be also added to this bridge, that can be
 also done manually by brctl addif orion_br interface_name. (see also Setup of Xavier for
 development)
